# Issue 1 â€” Refactor: Extract functions and add documentation

Description

The current `garden_advice.py` contains a small mapping and a minimal CLI. Refactor the code into clear, testable functions: `get_advice_for_month`, `get_advice_for_season`, and add module-level documentation and logging. Add unit tests for these functions.

Acceptance criteria

- `garden_advice.py` exposes well-documented functions.
- Unit tests (pytest / unittest) exist and pass.
- README updated with usage examples.

Notes

- TODO comments in `garden_advice.py` reference this issue.
