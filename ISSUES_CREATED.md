Note: The repository was empty on clone, and there is no automated authenticated access to GitHub from this environment, so these issue files are created locally under `.github/issues/`. If you want, I can create the real GitHub issues for you if you provide a GitHub token or run the `gh` CLI locally with your credentials.
